                <p>Greg was a great sales associate to work with! He took into consideration what we wanted in our first car and found several options that were the best fit for us. He also spent time explaining the whole process to make the car ours and took his time answering all of our questions. Would come back to buy our second or third car from him again!

                <p>Brenda was a wonderful technician to work with, she showed us what was wrong with our car, and also provided information with several options that our family could consider in repairing our car. She was also able to help us work with the financier in coming up with a payment plan as well. Would recommend her and Neptune’s Garage if you have any mechanical issues that need fixing.

                <p>This is our family’s third time buying a car from Neptune’s Garage. We love the team that works here. Feels like a family away from home. They always find a solution to find what would fit our needs and our budget. Don’t be shy to contact and even ask questions; they will never pressure customers to make a decision immediately.

                <p>Neptune’s Garage is a great place to get any sort of servicing done! They will work with you to ensure that your needs are met. I got my car’s spark plugs replaced fairly quickly and at a reasonable price. At another point in time I also had my car windows tinted and they did it at a great price too! Would recommend them every time.
