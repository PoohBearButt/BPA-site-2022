            <h4>Billy Bob</h4>
            <p>
              Greg was a great sales associate to work with! He took into
              consideration what we wanted in our first car and found several
              options that were the best fit for us. He also spent time
              explaining the whole process to make the car ours and took his
              time answering all of our questions. Would come back to buy our
              second or third car from him again!

            <h4>Cali Calico</h4>
            <p>
              Brenda was a wonderful technician to work with, she showed us what
              was wrong with our car, and also provided information with several
              options that our family could consider in repairing our car. She
              was also able to help us work with the financier in coming up with
              a payment plan as well. Would recommend her and Neptune’s Garage
              if you have any mechanical issues that need fixing.

            <h4>Fenny Flaker</h4>
            <p>
              This is our family’s third time buying a car from Neptune’s
              Garage. We love the team that works here. Feels like a family away
              from home. They always find a solution to find what would fit our
              needs and our budget. Don’t be shy to contact and even ask
              questions; they will never pressure customers to make a decision
              immediately.

            <h4>Dennis Drummer</h4>
            <p>
              Neptune’s Garage is a great place to get any sort of servicing
              done! They will work with you to ensure that your needs are met. I
              got my car’s spark plugs replaced fairly quickly and at a
              reasonable price. At another point in time I also had my car
              windows tinted and they did it at a great price too! Would
              recommend them every time.
